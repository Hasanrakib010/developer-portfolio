                my work effectively. My duties there includes taking classes, setting question papers, assesing answer
                scripts. I also have to keep proper documentation along with keeping proper communication with both the
                students and the officials of the institution. I have to do any other tasks assigned by the institution.
                Although i am happy to work here but i believe my proper destination lies elsewhere. So, i am trying to
                make a
