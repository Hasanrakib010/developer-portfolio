            <p>I have been working at Dr. Habibur Rahman IT School & College since 1<sup>st</sup> January, 2019 & doing
                my work effectively. My duties there includes taking classes, setting question papers, assesing answer
                scripts. I also have to keep proper documentation along with keeping proper communication with both the
                students and the officials of the institution. I have to do any other tasks assigned by the institution.
                Although i am happy to work here but i believe my proper destination lies elsewhere. So, i am trying to
                make a

            <p>I have already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website easily and host them with
                the help of github. I am about to learn advanced HTML, CSS & Bootstrap now. I have intentions to learn
                REST API,JSON,node, mongodb (database), chrome devtool, Javascript and its' framework "react" along with
                Firebase Authentication, TypeScript, Sass, Tailwind, Google Map api, MERN stack and many more...
                Gradually i am learning more and
                more about these things and stepping up a bit more to be a professional day by day</p>
